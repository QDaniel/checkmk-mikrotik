description:
 Creation time of local files of a MikroTik Router

 This check finds local files and checks age of creation time.
 It will go {WARN} or {CRIT} if thresholds are exceeded, that default to
 25h/49h. This is useful if local scripts should run on a regular base, e.g.
 download some blacklists. To extract timestamp from API output a configurable
 pattern is used.

 The watchdog crashfile {autosupout.rif} is {OK} if missing and {CRIT} on existing.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information): {MikroTik RouterOS} in
