description:
 Fans of a MikroTik RouterOS device.

 This check reports rpm of the fans of the device. Upper
 and lower thresholds for {WARN} and {CRIT} are set and can be
 adjusted.

 {ATTENTION}: mikrotik api might return non-existing fans with speed 0,
 so these will not inventarize.  There is no known way to tell this
 apart from a defective fan, so be careful on Service Scan.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information): {MikroTik RouterOS} in
