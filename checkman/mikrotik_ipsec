description:
 IPsec of a MikroTik Router

 This check reports status of ipsec connections.
 sa states not 'mature' or 'dying' will go {CRIT} (can be configured
 by a rule).
 It stays {OK} if an ipsec has no sa, but local IP address is marked
 invalid. Most likely this is a standby gateway.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information): {MikroTik RouterOS} in
